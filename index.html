      <h2>Ahoy</h2>
        <p>I'm Lee Wilson, a web developer who is curious about the inner workings of complex systems.
        Prior to becoming a developer I studied writing, political science, and urban planning, and worked as a technical writer and editor for major infrastructure projects in New York City and around the country.</p>
        <p>Also, cats love me.</p>

        <h3>FPL Stats Dashboard</h3>
          <p>Analyzes statistics for the Barclay's Premiere League fantasy soccer game and providing insights to the more than 4 million players. The project uses React, Express, Node, and PSQl to retrieve and parse data, as well as D3 to implement graphs.</p>

        <h3>ProʎektƐ</h3>
          <p>ProʎektƐ helps users make last minute decisions by searching for activities based on their location. The app uses the HTML5 geolocation feature to retrieve a users location, searches the Ticket Master API to show nearby events, and then the YouTube API to show relevant videos. Built using React, Express, Node, and PSQL.</p>
